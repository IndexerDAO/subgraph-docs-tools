# Version 1
## What 
Web app that let's a user generate Markdown-based Subgraph documentation from a GraphQL schema

## Why
The current process to write Subgraph documentation is a manual and tedious process, which explains why many development teams don't bother to document their Sugraphs. This is a non-ideal situation for dApp developers looking to leverage Subgraphs quickly, without spending too much time manually reading various GraphQL schemas. This tool automates the schema-to-documentation process, unblocking an important bottleneck in dApp development. 

## How
